## Description
------
This project was done to test/strengthen my understanding of the Sequelize library, Express routes, and Mysql2. When I created this project, it was in preparation for my beginning to learn the Handlebars system using an MVC approach. Having this knowledge embedded well would help me be able to focus on the concepts being taught in the MVC framework. Due to how important I understood the upcoming subject matter to be, I wanted to make sure I wasn't struggling with any previous technology. 

Being able to develop using Sequelize will help me in the future, because I won't necessarily have to focus on writing the SQL queries. Although I feel quite comfortable writing SQL, it is nice to get to some of the edge of the JavaScript language, and begin to understand that/how this language can be used in all aspects of full-stack development. I thought it was really cool being able to write rather complex SQL queries using just JavaScript.

Creating this project really instilled confidence in me, that I understood the Sequelize library, and Express routes. Going forward, I will need this information to be  readily available, in  order to succeed at learning MVC. This project acts as one of the capstones (personally) for my back-end development. This was the last project I created before learning MVC.

## Installation
------
This app can be installed by cloning the GitHub repository using the link above. After cloning the repo, be sure to run 'npn install',  to download any dependencies needed for the project. A local version of MySQL will also be needed, in order to run the program. The database schema and initial seed data is also included in the project. Use the schema.sql file to create the database, and then use the server.js file using the 'npm start server.js' command. You can then stop the server, and seed the database using the 'npm run seed' command. Afterwards, run the server.js command again, and the application is ready to go.



## Useage
------
When testing the app, I used Insomnia, to verify/test the routes. Any REST client (such as POSTMan) will do. Once you have a REST client, simply use it to call the routes included in the program.
